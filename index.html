          <p>All of my coding projects are on Github. Networking is a little bit more difficult tu publish, but I can say that I am able to create and maintain a multiple VLAN network with dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP), DNS, DHCP, NAT, VPN, QOS, Firewalling, radius 802.11X WPA authentication... and that on Cisco IOS, Ubiquiti Edge-OS, Ubiquiti Unifi, Router-OS, Open-WRT, PF-Sense, Linksys switches, HP switches... On the server side, I'm fluid with Windows server 2012/2016, debian and centos. At the client side, I can work with GNU/Linux, Mac OS and Windows.</p></font>
