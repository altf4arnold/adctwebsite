# This is CLEARLY not done (it s actually as usefull as a brick at the moment minus the capacity to build houses)

I'm trying to go to django and need for that to rebuild the entire website. I am building this branch as I learn and will 
merge when done.

Install guide :

virtualenv -p python3 ve3
source ve3/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver
